## What I learned

### Navigation Basics

- "Screens" (or "Routes", "Pages") are just widgets
- The Flutter Navigator allows you to switch (push/pop/replace) between pages
- That you can use named routes or unnamed routes

### Passing Data

- That data can be passed between pages via arguments (directly or via "arguments" key)
- Data can be passed back, too (read via Future)
- Data can be anything. (strings, ints, objects..)

### Tabs

- That you can add tabs in the AppBar or at the bottom of the page
- Tabs allow you to switch between different stacks (i.e. no popping)

### Drawers & Dialogs

- Drawers (side menus) also allow you to switch between different stacks
- Drawers and other dialogs (e.g. alerts, modal bottom sheet) can be closed via Navigator.pop()
